# RocketFace
It's a 3-level mini game project that I developed with Unity3D to learn level loads / passes (with level design), oscillation move and make particle effects.
It was made by following Rick Davidson's lecture: [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D series](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/) on Udemy and added changes.
